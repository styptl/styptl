- Create a folder named "GiftShop"
-   Download and place folders GiftShop, images, and local.
-     Go to the GiftShop folder and place the folders GiftShop, media, static and the file manage.py parallel to each other.
-     Create a folder "apps" (all lowercase) parallel to the rest of the folders.
-       Download and place folders cart, core, order, product, and vendor in the folder "apps."
      
The final directory tree should look like:

GiftShop -> GiftShop -----------------> apps --------------------> cart, core, order, product, vendor
         -> images                   -> GiftShop
                                     -> media
                                     -> static
                                     -> db.sqlite3
                                     -> manage.py
